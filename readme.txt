Adds a media button for the Grid Columns shortcode plugin to easily add the [column] shortcode to the post editor.

== Description ==

This plugin adds a media button to the post editor to easily insert the `[column]` shortcode and additional parameters from the [Grid Columns plugin](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/grid-columns/).

It should work with any editor (post, page, custom) and will add a "Insert Column" button next to the media button. The button will open a popup modal window where you can adjust the shortcode parameters.

== Installation ==

1. Install the plugin either via your dashboard, or by uploading the files to your `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Make sure the [Grid Columns](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/grid-columns/) plugin is activated.
4. Go to any editor and you should see the "Insert Column" button next to the media button.
